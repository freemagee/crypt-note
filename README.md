# Crypt-Note

Store and edit notes in the easy to use markdown format

## Project status

**Dormant. Do not use.**

The intention of this project is to store notes in the markdown format as encrypted plain text. This project does not have a backend currently, so the files are currently stored as .md files and served locally from the repo (static/notes).

Eventually this project will simply be the front-end and make requests to an api for the files. No files will be stored on disk.

I foresee the system having a login. The password would be one way hashed. That password could then act as the key to encrypt/decrypt the notes. I am new to the world of encryption, so I expect this to change.
