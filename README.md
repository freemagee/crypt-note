**Project not working. Just here for reference.**

This project is a progression from the master branch. A seperate API has been written and currently this front end can consume it. That API is not part of this project, therefore if you clone this repo you will not be able to run the front end without building your own API! (**and if you can do that, you can write the front end I am sure!**)

The intention of this project is to use encrypted text. Currently the API stores the notes in plain text. What I want is for the incoming encrypted content to be decrypted in the app and vice versa on save. When I get this working I hope to combine this into a working app hosted properly on a domain name somewhere.

# TODO

- Use a better alert/toastr system
- Related to previous, need a replacement for confirm
- Design sense check - does it work as expected on mobile?
- Move from SCSS to Tailwind
- Move from React class components to function components
- Use Redux for state management
